# Task Description

The aim of this task is to reconstruct 2D Ultrasound (US) images into a 3D volume.
The algorithm is expected to take the entire scan as input and output two different sets of
transformation-representing displacement vectors as results, a set of displacement vectors on individual pixels and a set of displacement vectors on provided landmarks. There is no requirement on how the algorithm is designed internally, for example, whether it is learning-based method; frame-, sequence- or scan-based processing; or, rigid-, affine- or nonrigid transformation assumptions. Details are explained further in [assessment](assessment.html).

Participant teams are expected to make use of the sequential data and potentially make knowledge transfer from other domains such as computer vision and computer-assisted intervention. The participant teams are expected to take US scan as input and output two sets of pixel displacement vectors, indicating the transformation to reference frame, i.e., first frame in this task. The evaluation process will take the generated displacement vectors from their dockerized models, and produce the final accuracy score to represent the reconstruction performance, at local and global levels, representing different clinical application of the reconstruction methods.

We have provide two baseline algorithms adapted from [Prevost et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2018.06.003) and [Li et al. 2023](https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2023.3325551) in this [repo](https://github.com/QiLi111/tus-rec-challenge_baseline).

# Application scenarios

Trackless 3D freehand US reconstruction will be useful in clinical practice where 3D visualisation is required but external trackers are not allowed or inaccessible. By estimating the relative transformations among US frames using solely 2D US images, the 3D position for each US frame could be calculated and thus the entire US scan could be reconstructed without using any information from external trackers.

# Difference between TUS-REC2025 and TUS-REC2024

From the results of TUS-REC2024, we observed that the reconstruction performance is dependent on scan protocol. In TUS-REC2025, we want to investigate the reconstruction performance on scans with a new rotating scanning protocol, with which the reconstruction performance may be further improved owing to its dense sampling of the area to be reconstructed. Compared with TUS-REC2024, TUS-REC2025 provides more data with new scanning protocol, and the previous released larger data with non-rotating scanning protocols is open to use. The new challenge aims to 1) benchmark the model performance on relatively small rotating data and 2) benchmark the model generalisation ability among different scanning protocols.
