# Participation Policy

- Submitted methods must be fully automatic.
- Both public and private data are allowed for use, but participants must disclose their utilization.
- Organizers may participate and be listed on leaderboards but are ineligible for awards.
- All participants must belong to teams, even if a team consists of only one member, and each participant can only be a member of one team.


# Data Usage Policy

The data is provided under [CC BY NC SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) license. It is exclusively intended for research purposes, in compliance with the restrictions imposed by the original ethics approval and patient consent.

Following the conclusion of the challenge, the training and validation data will remain publicly accessible. These datasets may be utilized within the research scope of the challenge and in subsequent research-related publications. However, commercial use of the training and validation data is prohibited. In cases where the intended use is ambiguous, participants accessing the data are requested to refrain from further distribution or utilization beyond the scope of this challenge.

# Publication Policy

We are planning to submit a paper including challenge dataset summary and results analysis. Members of the top five participating teams will be invited as co-authors. The participating teams can only publish their novel methodology without discussion of data and obtained results if the above mentioned paper is not published (submission to arXiv is considered as a sufficient waiting period). Once the challenge paper from the organizing team is published, the participants should cite this challenge paper if their work has not been published.

# Participant Code of Conduct

By participating in this challenge, whether as an organizer or participant, you commit to ensuring that participation in our community remains a harassment-free experience for all, irrespective of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Your pledge includes conducting yourself in a manner that fosters an environment characterized by openness, inclusivity, diversity, and health.


*Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:*

- Showing empathy and kindness towards others
- Respecting diverse opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Offering and graciously receiving constructive feedback
- Taking accountability and apologizing to those impacted by our errors, and using the opportunity for growth
- Prioritizing the collective welfare of the community, not just individual interests


*Examples of unacceptable behavior include:*

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are tasked with elucidating and upholding our standards of acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and equitable corrective measures in response to any conduct they perceive as inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the authority and obligation to delete, edit, or decline comments, code, discussion board entries, issues, and other contributions that deviate from this Code of Conduct. They will provide explanations for moderation decisions when deemed appropriate.


## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces, whether online or during in-person events.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [`qi.li.21@ucl.ac.uk`](mailto:qi.li.21@ucl.ac.uk). All complaints will be promptly and fairly reviewed and investigated.
